# Stochastic-Processes
Stochastic process of pedestrians walking through a shopping center.
There are a total of six pedestrians. Three starting at each portion of the corridor. 
The program uses a mean path to guide pedestrians through the corridor. 
The rectangular structure at the top left represents a store.
The rectangle near the center represents a food vender. 
A timer is initiated if a pedestrian enters either of these.
Also, there is a radius of effect that creates a pull on each of the pedestrians (if their mean path takes them into the radius).
